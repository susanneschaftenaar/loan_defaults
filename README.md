# loan_defaults

This repository contains files for my project on predicting loan defaults. This project was part of a PhD-level course: "Machine Learning with R: Advanced" taken at GSERM, St:Gallen in Summer 2021. I won first place in the course-organised machine learning competition and received the highest attainable grade (6/6, A in ECTS-system)

The repository contains the original data provided, the r-scripts, an R Markdown document and its related html document. Most code is run within the R-script due to its large memory usage rather than in R Markdown, but figures etc. were imported to the R Markdown document for the course's final report.
